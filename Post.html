				<h2>Best Game Or Not?</a></h2>

				<p> <h5>Is this the best game of 2016?</h5></p>
				<p> It’s impossible to understate just how amazing Uncharted 4 looks. It’s not just that the graphics are technically impressive; it’s the size and solidity of the game world they create, the almost perfectly realised characters, and the incredible cinematic timing of both the gameplay and the cut scenes. Technology will outdate it sooner or later but it’s the unparalleled craftsmanship that makes Uncharted 4 one of the most astonishing visual experiences in all gaming. Although it helps that it also plays pretty well too…</p>
				<p> Although there is a remaster trilogy collection on PlayStation 4, many Xbox 360 owners will have missed out on the original Uncharted games. As such they’re just as likely to know developer Naughty Dog for The Last Of Us as anything else (or perhaps they remember them for Crash Bandicoot, which has a surprising cameo in Uncharted 4). The basic third person gameplay is similar to The Last Of Us, except instead of a zombie apocalypse Uncharted deals with a more light-hearted Indiana Jones style action adventure.</p>
				<p> You don’t need to have played the previous games to get to grips with this new one, as there’s no continuing storyline and only a few returning characters. The plot is also extremely straightforward: regular lead Nathan ‘Nate’ Drake is a semi-retired treasure hunter who, thanks to his brother Sam, becomes embroiled in a quest to find the mother of all pirate treasure hordes. Although we have to say we never found Sam as much fun as series regulars Sully and Elena, and we resented the decreased screen time they’re given as a result.</p>
